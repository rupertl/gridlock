# Ideas for improving Gridlock

* Convert to uv https://github.com/astral-sh/uv
* Add end-to-end tests
* Make an interactive grid viewer where you can change the variance
  threshold via a slider and click on cells to mark them as
  character/whitespace.
* Add support for more LLMs
* Find a better merge algorithm
* Use hOCR for data interchange
* A utility like diff that can show text positioning and individual
  character errors rather than line by line comparison for easier
  evaluation.
